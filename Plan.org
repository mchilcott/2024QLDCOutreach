  - What other countries are doing to incubate quantum technologies?
* What is quantum?
  - Atoms and Light
    - Atomic spectra
    - Lasers
  - Electronics
    - Transistors, etc
  - Blackbody radiation

  - GPS Atomic clocks

  - Wave/particle duality
  - Superposition and Entanglment
  - Quantum mechanics is the most thoroughly tested theory in human history

  - Probably don't want to deal with measurement, except perhaps stern gerlag

    - Analogy to IC: complex thing with lots of wires to interface with the rest of the world.
    - Something like computing different superpositions at once....

* Revised
  - 

  - Throwing around magnets (Stern-Gerlag)
    - Start with sticking, compassing
    - Throw it so it doesn't: deflection
    - Throw it upside down: Opposite deflection
    - Throw it straight: Basically no deflection
    - Throw it randomly: Everywhere

    - Silver atoms: Also magnets
      - Only get up or down
      - Quantized!!!!
    - Does physics break if you turn your head sideways?
      - Of course not. Up/Down only special because this is the way we
        decided to measure
      - Actually a superposition
    - Cascading S/G machines
      - To put some examples of measurement
    - You can start with a superposition, but once you make a
      measurement, that's what you have
    - You can also have superpositions over different particles - entanglement
      - Very weird: measuring one seems to have an effect the other
	- "Spooky action at a distance"

  - Light
    - Newton: particles, Hygens: Wave
    - Double slit experiment
      - Wave superposition
      - Light is wave
      - White light: colour is wavelength
    - Photoelectric effect
      - Light is particle
      - More light intensity, more electrons
      - Wavelengt/colour is energy in a photon, one photon to one electron
    - Double slits:
      - You can do it with a single photon. (Though if you look at which slit it goes through, it only goes through one)
      - You can do it with electrons---they're waves too
      - You can do it with molecules---everything is a wave. In general, more massive, shorter wavelength and therefore harder to notice.
      - Everything is kinda both, and you'll see wave/particle like behaviour if you look for it.

  Quantum Technologies Today:
  - Lasers
  - GPS/Atomic clocks
  - MRI
  - Transistor
  - "Quantum 1.0"

  Quantum Technologies Tomorrow:
  - Measurement: Indentical particles, and short wavelengths
    - Electric field sensing
    - Magnetic field sensing
    - Inertial nagigation in planes
  - Quantum 2.0 - Entanglement + superpositions
  - Quantum computing
    - Solves some hard problems efficiently
    - Cryptography: also can tell if someone is listening in
  - Simulation
    - Simulating a Quantum is hard, so make a quantum system that looks like a quantum system
